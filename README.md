# Holidates

## Project.
In my BeCode formation, I was asked to use Node.js to create command lines in order to retrieve the countries' holidays.

## How to use.

#### Install this in the terminal :

> npm i asce-cli

#### Use this command line to retrieve the country :

> holidates country

### Example.

#### Order line for Belgium :

> holidates Belgium

#### The result is :
